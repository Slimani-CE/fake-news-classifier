## Data Pre-processing
Data pre-processing steps are performed to clean and transform the dataset. Null values are replaced with empty strings, and the title, author, and text columns are merged into a single column called 'content'. The text is then processed using stemming and removing stopwords.

## The Model 
A Logistic Regression model is trained using the training set.
